# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to comprehensively modernize the ASTM library to bring it up to current Python standards and best practices. The library currently handles ASTM E1381/E1394 protocol communication for medical and laboratory equipment but lacks modern Python features, comprehensive testing, proper documentation, type safety, and contemporary development practices. The modernization will transform this into a production-ready, maintainable, and extensible library that follows current industry standards.

## Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN the library SHALL achieve >95% code coverage
2. WHEN contributing code THEN the library SHALL enforce quality through pre-commit hooks
3. WHEN building the library THEN it SHALL pass all linting, formatting, and type checking
4. WHEN testing ASTM communication THEN it SHALL include integration tests with mock devices
5. WHEN validating functionality THEN it SHALL include property-based testing for protocol compliance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working with various ASTM devices, I want flexible configuration and device profiles, so that I can easily adapt the library to different equipment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN customizing communication THEN the library SHALL allow field mapping and validation overrides
3. WHEN handling device-specific quirks THEN the library SHALL provide extensible record parsing
4. WHEN managing configurations THEN the library SHALL support YAML/JSON configuration files
5. WHEN switching between devices THEN the library SHALL allow runtime profile selection

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer building production systems, I want robust async support and connection management, so that I can handle multiple concurrent ASTM connections efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling multiple devices THEN the library SHALL support concurrent async connections
2. WHEN connections fail THEN the library SHALL implement automatic reconnection with backoff
3. WHEN managing resources THEN the library SHALL provide proper connection pooling
4. WHEN monitoring connections THEN the library SHALL offer health checking and status reporting
5. WHEN scaling applications THEN the library SHALL handle connection limits and queuing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with modern systems, I want comprehensive serialization and data validation, so that I can easily convert ASTM data to/from common formats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting data THEN the library SHALL support JSON, XML, and CSV serialization
2. WHEN importing data THEN the library SHALL validate against ASTM field specifications
3. WHEN processing records THEN the library SHALL provide Pydantic model integration
4. WHEN handling data types THEN the library SHALL support proper datetime, decimal, and enum handling
5. WHEN validating messages THEN the library SHALL enforce ASTM protocol constraints

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer learning or debugging ASTM communication, I want excellent documentation and examples, so that I can quickly understand and implement the library.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN learning the library THEN it SHALL provide comprehensive API documentation with examples
2. WHEN implementing common patterns THEN it SHALL include cookbook-style guides
3. WHEN troubleshooting THEN it SHALL offer debugging guides and common issue solutions
4. WHEN exploring features THEN it SHALL provide interactive examples and tutorials
5. WHEN contributing THEN it SHALL include clear development and contribution guidelines

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer building secure medical systems, I want security features and compliance support, so that I can meet healthcare data protection requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transmitting data THEN the library SHALL support TLS encryption for network communication
2. WHEN logging sensitive data THEN the library SHALL provide data masking and sanitization
3. WHEN validating inputs THEN the library SHALL prevent injection attacks and malformed data
4. WHEN auditing THEN the library SHALL support audit logging for compliance requirements
5. WHEN handling PHI THEN the library SHALL provide HIPAA-compliant data handling guidelines

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer monitoring production systems, I want observability and metrics, so that I can track performance and diagnose issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the library SHALL provide metrics for message throughput and latency
2. WHEN tracking usage THEN the library SHALL support integration with monitoring systems (Prometheus, etc.)
3. WHEN debugging issues THEN the library SHALL offer distributed tracing support
4. WHEN analyzing patterns THEN the library SHALL provide connection and error statistics
5. WHEN alerting THEN the library SHALL support custom metric thresholds and notifications

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer extending the library, I want a plugin system and extensibility, so that I can add custom functionality without modifying core code.

#### Acceptance Criteria
