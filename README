# ASTMIO

Python implementation of ASTM E1381/1394 data protocol.

This project aims to solve three tasks:

1. Provide decoder ASTM data to Python objects and encode them back to valid
   ASTM messages.

2. Provide ability to create your own ASTM client and server applications
   followed by common specification routines.

3. Provide ready-to-use "drivers" for various ASTM-driven analysers,
   middlewares and other software or hardware solutions.


Depending on your needs you may use this project in one of these ways.
Currently, all communication routines are implemented for TCP/IP protocol driven
by a bit improved standard asynclib.
